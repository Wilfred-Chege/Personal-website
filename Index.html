    <h1>Overview</h1>
    My background is in venture building where I hold a Barchelors degree in Business and Information from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. I am a 2x founder with 8 years experience. I founded my first start-up called Shulemall when I was 16 years old while still in secondary school. I am currently building Zendawa. My dedication to leveraging technology in solving Africa's age old woes has earned me several accolades. I was selected as an Anzisha fellow in 2020 and went to win the Global Student Entrepreneur Kenya Award in 2022. I am also a Jury member for Global Start-up Awards Africa.
